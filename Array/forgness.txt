*************************************Forgiveness**************************************

Forgiveness is a gift you give to yourself.

To err is human, to forgive is divine.

“Forgiveness is like faith. You have to keep reviving it.”

“To forgive is the highest, most beautiful form of love. In return, you will receive untold peace and happiness.”

“Not forgiving is like drinking rat poison and then waiting for the rat to die.”

“Let us forgive each other – only then will we live in peace.”

“Anger makes you smaller, while forgiveness forces you to grow beyond what you were.”

“To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you.”

“Forgiveness is not an occasional act, it is a constant attitude.”

“Letting go doesn’t mean that you don’t care about someone anymore. It’s just realizing that the only person you really have control over is yourself.”

“Throughout life people will make you mad, disrespect you and treat you bad. Let God deal with the things they do, cause hate in your heart will consume you too.”

“Be the one who nurtures and builds. Be the one who has an understanding and a forgiving heart one who looks for the best in people. Leave people better than you found them.”

“Forgiveness is the sweetest revenge.”

“Forgiveness is the giving, and so the receiving, of life.”


“Don’t dwell on what went wrong. Instead, focus on what to do next. Spend your energy moving forward together towards an answer.”

“When we go back in to the past and rake up all the troubles we've had, we end up reeling and staggering through life. Stability and peace of mind come by living in the moment.”

“You can clutch the past so tightly to your chest that it leaves your arms too full to embrace the present.”

Forgiveness will bring you best of health, peace of mind and physical strength.

Forgiveness doesnt change the past but It does changes/enlarges your future for sure.

Forgive others, not because they deserve it but because you deseve peace.

The weak can never forgive, it is the attribute of the strong.

I belive forgiveness is the best form of love in any relationship. It takes a strong person to say they're sorry and an even stronger person to forgive.

Let no man pull you low enough to hate him.
